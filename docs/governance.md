# SecretSwap Governance

The Secret Finance ecosystem has implemented a governance token, `SEFI`, for the community to be able to decide on changes to the protocols.

Once fully implemented, `SEFI` holders will be able to vote on changes to SecretSwap such as:

- Liquidity Provider fees
- LP token staking
- Enhancement proposals

You can obtain `SEFI` tokens on SecretSwap, as well as earn them by providing liquidity on selected trading pairs.

For details on the tokenomics of `SEFI`, see [this blog post](https://scrt.network/blog/sefi-governance-token-for-secret-defi).
